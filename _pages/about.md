Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in Quantum Machine Learning at the [Laboratoire des signaux et systèmes (L2S)](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/), [CentraleSupélec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentraleSup%C3%A9lec), [Paris-Saclay University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University).
My doctoral speciality is Mathematical Computer Science (Informatique mathématique).
I completed my Master’s studies at ENS Paris-Saclay and my Bachelor’s degree at Paris Cité University.
I’m always happy to exchange ideas and collaborate, you can reach me at le­tao.wang [at] centralesupelec.fr :)

My research interests include:
- Quantum physics-informed neural networks (QPINNs)
- Variational quantum algorithms for solving PDEs
- Quantum optimization for financial problems
